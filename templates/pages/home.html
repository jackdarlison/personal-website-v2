    <h1> Jack Darlison. </h1>

    <p>Hey there, I'm Jack Darlison!</p>

    <p>I am a professional software engineer, employed at Barclays on their graduate developer program. Currently my day-to-day focuses on working on services using a Java, Spring, and Kafka tech stack.</p>

    <p>I have a first class MEng Computer Science degree from the University of Southampton. Here I gained a broad range of experience, such as implementing novel deep learning models, designing and verifying programming languages, and deploying financial models.</p>

    <p>Outside of my passion for all things computer science, I enjoy running, climbing and gaming. Typical, I know.</p>
