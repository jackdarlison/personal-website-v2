    <h1> Jack Darlison. </h1>

    <p>Hey there, I'm Jack Darlison!</p>

    <p>I am a professional software developer employed at Barclays. Currently my day-to-day focuses on contributing to a peta-byte scale AWS datamart and improving the developer ecosystem for my team. Previously I worked on full-stack service using a Spring, Kafka, and React tech stack.</p>

    <p>I obtained a first class MEng Computer Science degree from the University of Southampton. Here I gained a broad range of experience, such as implementing novel deep learning models, designing and verifying programming languages, and creating algorithms for analysing financial models.</p>

    <p>Outside of my passion for all things computer science, I enjoy running, climbing and gaming. Typical, I know.</p>

    <p>Check out the projects tab to find interactive works or read through the blogs page to delve deeper into things I have made. Enjoy!</p>
